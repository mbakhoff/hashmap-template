    // create at least one failing test for the Company class:
    // * the test should use Company as a hashmap key
    // * the test should demonstrate a problem caused by the mutable
    //   key, e.g. the map fails to find a value that should be present
    // * explain why the test fails
    //
    // hint: think how the hashmap works and what happens
    // with the key when its fields change.

    // TODO add the test code here
